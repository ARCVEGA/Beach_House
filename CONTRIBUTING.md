First of all, thank you for contributing to this project. There are a few rules that we would like you to follow if you are planning on contributing to this project.

### Basic Rules

1. Keep your code as modulare as possible to avoid any unnecesary dependencies that may casue issues in the future.
2. Clearly explain what your code does and why it should be included in the project. This makes it a lot easier for us to decide if the feature can be integrated, or if it needs to be refined.
3. Document your code using JavaDocs, this helps not only others who might end up using your code, but it will make it easier for us to figure out what your code does
4. Be civilized, not everyone shares the same views regarding what should or shouldn't be added and thats ok. 


## How do I contribute to the code?

In order to contribute, its best if you find an issue which is open and try to resolve it. You should **fork** the project to work on your implementation, and request to merge with the original branch once you have completed said changes. 


## How do I know what to do?
 
You have two options here:
1. You can look at existing issues or bugs and try to resolve them
2. You can propose a new feature and create an implementation which we will then look at once you have made a pull request


## Can I contribute in ways which don't involve having to write code?

Yes! You can always stay on the look out for bugs that might pop up when running the program, or if you think that you have some neat ideas that may improve the project, you can alwasy leave a feature request (`enhancement`) in the `issues` forum.
