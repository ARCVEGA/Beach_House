### First of all, thank you for contributing to this project!

There are a few rules that we would like you to follow if you are planning on contributing to this project. We ask this to ensure that this project can grow over time with productivity and openness as foundational concepts.


### Basic Rules

1. Keep your code as modulare as possible to avoid any unnecesary dependencies that may casue issues in the future.
   - You should be enforcing encapsulation in your classes and managing access to member variables appropriatly
    
2. Clearly explain what your code does and why it should be included in the project in your pull request. This makes it a lot easier for us to decide if the feature can be integrated, or if it needs to be refined.

3. Document your code using JavaDocs. Doing this helps others who might end up using your code, and it makes it easier for us to figure out what your code does when you make a pull request.

4. Be civilized, not everyone shares the same views regarding what should or shouldn't be added and thats ok. Just be mindful of other people.

5. The templates that we have created are there for a reason, make use of them because it makes everyones life significantly easier.


## How do I contribute to the code?

In order to contribute, its best if you find an issue which is open and try to resolve it. You should **fork** the project to work on your implementation, and request to merge with the original branch once you have completed said changes. 


## How do I know what to do?
 
You have two options here:
1. You can look at existing issues or bugs and try to resolve them
2. You can propose a new feature and create an implementation which we will then look at once you have made a pull request


## Can I contribute in ways which don't involve having to write code?

Yes! You can always stay on the look out for bugs that might pop up when running the program, or if you think that you have some neat ideas that may improve the project, you can alwasy leave a feature request (`enhancement`) in the `issues` forum.
