## First of all, thank you for contributing to this project!

There are a few rules that we would like you to follow if you are planning on contributing to this project. We ask this to ensure that this project can grow over time with productivity and openness as foundational concepts.


### Basic Rules

1. Keep your code as modulare as possible to avoid any unnecesary dependencies that may casue issues in the future.
   - You should be enforcing encapsulation in your classes and managing access to member variables appropriatly
    
2. Clearly explain what your code does and why it should be included in the project in your pull request. This makes it a lot easier for us to decide if the feature can be integrated, or if it needs to be refined.

3. Document your code using JavaDocs. Doing this helps others who might end up using your code, and it makes it easier for us to figure out what your code does when you make a pull request.

4. Be civilized, not everyone shares the same views regarding what should or shouldn't be added and thats ok. Just be mindful of other people.

5. The templates that we have created are there for a reason, make use of them because it makes everyones life significantly easier.


## How do I contribute to the code?

In order to contribute to this project, **fork** the repo and work on your implementation on the newly forked version. Once you have completed the bugfix or feature and are happy with it, you can request to merge with the original branch. We will be monitoring the repo and address pull requests. 


### My PR was rejected, what do I do?

You may not get your changes accepted the first time arround, but dont let that discourage you. This will usually happend under a variety of circumstances:

- Your code is messy and proned to bugs 
- Your code does not provide appropriate functionality to the project
- The code you submitted crashes or doesn't work
- You are missing a requriement listed in the PR template 
- The feature you added either exists already or is nor elevant at the current stage of the project
- et.

If you have questions about why your changes weren't accepted and what you can just ask one of the maintainers. We will usually leave comments and mention anything that we feel should be changed in the PR review, but if its still unclear just ask. 


## How do I know what to contribute?
 
You have two options here:
1. You can look at existing issues or bugs and try to resolve them
2. You can propose a new feature and create an implementation which we will then look at once you have made a pull request


## Can I contribute in ways which don't involve having to write code?

Yes! You can always stay on the look out for bugs that might pop up when running the program, or if you think that you have some neat ideas that may improve the project, you can alwasy leave a feature request (`enhancement`) in the `issues` forum.
