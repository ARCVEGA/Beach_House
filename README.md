# Beach House

## Running

The project uses Gradle as its dependency manager. To download the dependencies,
run `gradle build`. This will generate a jar which can easily be run using `gradlew :run`.

An alternative way would be to run the project using one of the main entry points
straight from an IDE. These are located at  `com.arcvega.simulation.config.Simulation` 
or `com.arcvega.simulation.config.SimulationWithUI`.
