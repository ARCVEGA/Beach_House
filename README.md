# Beach House

#### Synopsis

The Beach House theory proposes the notion that an individual who is unable to throw an american football in a spiraling motion, has a drastically reduced probability of reproducing. Furthermore the theory is founded on the notion that, the male leader of a family structure can be though of as a great filter which dictates if an individual will be accepted or rejected from the collective. The Beach House theory was proposed by **Matthew Colbourne** on June 11th 2020.

#### Proposal Paper Abstract excerpt 

In this paper we discuss the potential of the combined effects of convergent evolution, and the “great filter” (an event which precludes the continuation of individual genes that lack specific characteristics) effect on the human species, especially with relation to filial involvement in reproductive selection. We propose a primary “great filter” of filial decision, originating from the male leader of the family unit, and based on the cultural markings of adequate levels of masculinity as an indicator of survivability of potential mates for the females of breeding age within the unit. We use a statistical model to predict the amount of time necessary for this convergent evolution to entirely replace the current gene pool of potential mates with those predisposed to the cultural markings of masculinity (namely sports interest).


## Running

The project uses Gradle as its dependency manager. To download the dependencies,
run `gradle build`. This will generate a jar which can easily be run using `gradlew :run`.

An alternative way would be to run the project using one of the main entry points
straight from an IDE. These are located at  `com.arcvega.simulation.config.Simulation` 
or `com.arcvega.simulation.config.SimulationWithUI`.
